# Frontend Mentor - Product feedback app solution

This is a solution to the [Product feedback app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-feedback-app-wbvUYqjR6). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- Filter suggestions by category
- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
- Upvote product feedback requests
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
